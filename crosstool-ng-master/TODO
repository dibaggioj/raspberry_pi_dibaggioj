This is a somewhat ordered TODO list:

Recurring tasks:

- update versions for every tools...

- update and/or upgrade all samples


Non-recurring tasks:

- update newlib (for enhanced bare metal)
  - confirm existing implementation on targets other than AVR32
  - try to make it generic, will help for uClibc++

- multilib

- Cygwin target (needs newlib)
  - so we can build toolchains that generate code for Windows/Cygwin

- uClibc++
  - see newlib, above

- uClinux
  - check whether we can use newlib under uClinux (?)

- Darwin / Clang
  - driverdriver needs to be added to the project

  - llvm-gcc needs to work again.

  - HOST_LINK_VERSION is used instead of `${program-prefix}-ld --version`

  - `${program-prefix}-ld -v` yields @(#)PROGRAM:ld  PROJECT:cctools-809
    instead of e.g. @(#)PROGRAM:ld  PROJECT:ld64-127

  - Add llvm-config-build and llvm-config-host for when going Canadian.

  - Consider adding PPC support?

  - Copy cctools' needed SDK headers from the SDK at patch-time instead
    of providing them in a patch - needs an OSX SDK to be identified
    though, even for an iPhone build.

- Python Support
  - gdb has Python integration, so add option to build Python.

- LLDB Support
  - Add this, it also has Python integration.
